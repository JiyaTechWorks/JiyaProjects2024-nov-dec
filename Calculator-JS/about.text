Hey, this is Jiya (myself). Time: 9:45 PM, Date: 30th Nov 2024.

So, I started this project this afternoon and just wrapped it up now. I did take a few breaks in between, and there was some brainstorming along the way.
However, there’s one thing I’m feeling a bit sad about – I ended up using the built-in eval() function. But, no worries! I’ve learned a lot from this experience, and next time, I’ll definitely try my best to do everything manually and without relying on shortcuts.
This is my first project on GitHub, so naturally, I’ve been feeling quite excited throughout the day, wondering when it would be completed. I’m happy to have finally finished it, but at the same time, I know there’s always room for improvement.
Today, I did waste some time, and I’m a bit disappointed about that. But I’ve realized that mistakes are part of the process, and as long as I keep learning from them, I’ll keep moving forward. I know that if I focus and give my best, I can take on much bigger projects in the future, ones that will push me even further in my learning journey.
That’s it for today. Good night! Time to unwind and think about what my next project will be. I’m excited to see where my skills will take me.

Hey Jiya(myself),
Time: 9:53 AM, Date:2nd Dec 2024.
First of all, I want to apologize for wasting time on 1st dec. I knw I could have easily completed this project yesterday, but I ended up wasting time.
Yesterday, I got caught up in playing COC(clash of clans) and didn't manage my time well, then I went to the terrace and got distracted as well.

And you knw what? I starded working on an Analog clock yesterday, but the logic was a lit bit complicated, and the design ifself was challenging.
Plus, ChatGPT wasn't giving me a good design, which made it even harder. So, after struggling with it for a while, I decided to quit the analog clock project and switch to a digtal clock instead.
I'm glad I made the change becoz by the afternoon, I had already completed the disign, and this morning, I added the logic. 
honestly, I'm really happy with the results. Seeing my project work successfully feels so rewarding.

But now, I am not going to stop here. I've set myself a goal to complete another project today to make up for the time I wasted yesterday. I need to finisH it today itself, so I can feel like I've accomplished something more.

So yeah, that's the plan for today. let's get started and keep pushing forward
Okay, So byeeee.
